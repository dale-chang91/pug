*Process, Understand, Generate*
PUG stands for several pillars of NLP: Natural Language **Processing**, Natural Language **Understanding**, and Natural Language **Generation**, or **PUG**

This project was created because let's face it, there's a lot of redundancy in the world of hiring and employment. I am talking about:
* All of the recruiters
* All of the cover letters written
* All of the resume flavors written
* All of the hiring managers

This project seeks to fill a need that LinkedIn doesn't exactly provide. Whereas LinkedIn is a network for former, current, and future colleagues, this project is a way to compare work histories and skills at a more objective level. Think shopping and comparing candidates like baseball cards, Pokemon cards, or computers online.

This can be done because software engineers, management, and employees generate so much data. Imagine having all of the employee's work history at your fingertips, able to be queried in a Google-like fashion. Need an obscure technology? You can search for it. This is an extension of the current resume database which recruiting offices currently hold, except powered by more data. Eventually, PUG will be able to tie-in all of your previous JIRA and Kanban tasks, and even further down the line, Github code directly written by an individual. When performed right, PUG can be a powerful tool not only in the employment world, but also in the education domain for colleges to find the set of hard and soft skills in which they are interested.
